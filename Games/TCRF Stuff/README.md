Bejeweled Twist: 
Enabled [hidden debugging features](https://tcrf.net/Bejeweled_Twist_(Adobe_Flash)). Note: This was actually how the game came on Flashpoint. However, it was not documented anywhere. In case the above link gets taken down, the debugging features are essentially keyhacks:


1: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a blue diamond

2: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a white gem

3: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into an orange gem

4: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a yellow gem

5: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a red gem

6: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a purple triangle gem

7: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a green gem

Note: Changing jewels this way to jewels that make a match on the field will not automatically clear them, nor will it turn them into flame or lightning jewels.

[Tab]: Increases current level by 10 (display only shows the first 2 digits, but it is possible to advance past level 99 otherwise)

B: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a bomb gem

C: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a piece of coal

F: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a flame gem (will not overwrite coal)

K: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a locked gem (activates upon making 1 move)

L: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a lightning gem (will not overwrite coal)

M: Adds ticks to the combo counter in the top left. Maxing out the counter past 10x spawns a fruit gem.

N: Turns jewel under the mouse cursor into a fruit gem (will not overwrite coal)

Q: Quits the game back to the title screen.

T: Unused/dummied (code refers to something called CheckTweener, which has no programmed functions)

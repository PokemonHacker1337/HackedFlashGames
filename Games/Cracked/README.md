Flash games that I have personally cracked. You may take these without crediting me, although it would be appreciated if you did. Feel free to download these for yourself or reupload for others to play.

Ace Gangster Taxi:
Upgrade menu unlocked.

Age of War 2:
Insane difficulty unlocked.

Creeper World 2:
Rerouted the sitelock to not care if it isn't running on an approved website.

Exit Path 2:
Fixed the crash after the original loading screen (I hope). Note: the starting cutscene will never load as it is attempting to grab a video from a website that is no longer around.

Gazzoline:
Bypassed Kongregate website requirements regarding certain items in the store. 

Learn to Fly 2:
Omega Catalog may be bought, Sponsored By achievement activates as soon as the shop is accessed.

Research upgrades can be upgraded to 100, as opposed to the normal 10. Ads have been removed.

Attempted to unlock the CMG only levels. Untested though, it might be broken.

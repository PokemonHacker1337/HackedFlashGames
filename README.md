(Note: this is a little bugged. ~~I don't know if I ever am going to come back to this~~ (Edit: I did), but a cracked version is available in the cracked folder if you want to try it yourself. I'm aware of the following bugs, but I don't really know how to fix them: Crash after finishing the game and most obstacles have graphical bugs (like the circle saws animate weirdly and the lasers don't go off. The latter might be an issue of the way I programmed the invincibility (removing the code that makes you die when you touch certain objects). I'll make a version of this without invincibility as I believe that that is the cause. Another issue is the intro and finishing cutscenes. I can't do much there as they are supposed to run a .flv file from the Internet at a website that is no longer around (so it never loads, and I'm glad that you are allowed to skip the cutscenes). I did get the cutscenes from Flashpoint, but I'm not sure how to set it up in a way that it will work. At the moment, I cannot recommend using this one unless you want invincibility and are willing to sacrifice having bugs).

Exit Path 2 (1.1):
Infinite overFlow, infinite midair jumps.

Exit Path 2 (possibly final):
Infinite overFlow, infinite midair jumps, invincibility (including from falling down pits. Reset the level if you fall down a pit and cannot find yourself).

FAQ (yes, I ramble and go on tangents a lot, sorry):

Q: Where did you get the games from?

A: Usually [Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/downloads/) or finding the SWFs online. There are lots of people who have archived Flash games, so I may take from them as well.

Q: I want to do the same thing as you/What did you use to make these?

A: That would be a very long answer, but I highly recommend picking up a copy of [Adobe Flash Projector](https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html) as well as [ffdec](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases), both of which are free. I recommend messing around with games that you've played and just change things, like find what controls the money you start with (like in RPG style games) and increase that to see if you can make yourself start rich. Knowing a few basic programming concepts would make it easier, but I'm not sure if it's required. Many games are programmed differently, so get creative and explore, maybe you'll make amazing hacks yourself.

Q: What's the difference between hacked and cracked?

A: Cracked games are games that I have not placed any hacks in, instead choosing to remove or bypass any protections on the games that limit their functionality, like sitelocks (games that don't let you perform certain actions or play them unless you play on an approved website). I feel that this is allowed as most (if not all) major browsers have disabled Flash support, so you aren't able to play them through legitimate means. On the other hand, hacks are a change to the game that allow for things not normally possible, like infinite money, infinite ammo, starting with all levels and weapons, etc. Hacks are great for learning a game to speedrun it (like having enough money to buy endgame content early), or just to casually mess around, like massively outspeed your opponents in racing games.

Q: How do you decide which games to hack? 

A: Usually, I just decide based on games that I've played in the past or know particularly well (like Earn to Die and Super Mario 63). With those, I know a lot more about how they work, so I don't have to figure things out for the first time. Flashpoint has also pointed me to some more that I haven't heard of (like I never knew that Exit Path had a sequel until last year when I was messing around with games). Sometimes, I find that a game hasn't been hacked before (like Exit Path 2) and feel that it should have a hack available for others to mess with (which is why I made 2). Or maybe I dislike what the current hacks have to offer and want to add something else (for example, most Exit Path hacks only have infinite flow, but I thought that invincibility would be a cool addition to add). Of course, some hackers are way better than me, as I'm not particularly good at programming, and I'm sure they will have a great future with ethical hacking if that's the road that they end up going down. 

Q: Will you teach me how to hack X game?

A: Probably not, especially if it's an online game. Online games mostly keep their stuff on their servers. And there are some games that I'm not familiar with and don't know how to play them. If it's a game that you are familiar with, I recommend starting with things you know about the game, like finding the starting amount of money and changing it. However, many games store data under different names. Some might refer to money as money, or as cash, or as dinero in Spanish based games. I still wouldn't want to hack online games unless everyone was fine with it, especially as cheaters ruin the entire experience (just look at the hacking problem on modern games like Among Us).

Q: What inspired you to hack Flash games?

A: Back when I was younger in the early 2010s, there were multiple websites with hacked Flash games like HackedArcadeGames and [ArcadePreHacks](https://arcadeprehacks.com) where hackers could post hacked games for others to play. Naturally, I got pretty jealous, and I always wanted to see how they did that. Fast forward to 2020, where a certain virus was killing millions of people, and I was taking classes related to programming (I was bored at home, couldn't go anywhere), and I got some information that helped me get a general idea as to how they did that. Now with free programs like ffdec (not sponsored), anyone with a computer can open up the source code of a Flash game and explore it to see what makes it tick. I broke many games just messing around seeing what happens if I change stuff around (one of my first hacks was hacking Super Mario 63 to increase the water you had in the tank every time you used FLUDD) or just change things in general. In addition, I had lots of fun with Action Replay and GameShark/Game Genie codes on games and emulators.

Q: How do you crack Flash games?

A: Well, a lot of them will be different as there are multiple ways that the game may be protected. There are games like Super Mario 63 where they have very little, except they will have a thing at the loading screen saying where the game came from and that's it. There are games like Learn to Fly 2 and Learn to Fly Idle where the protection is a bit more obvious, like the game can still be played, but there are limitations, like certain upgrades are unobtainable unless you are at the developer's website, or there is a limit on how far you may go in the story, or certain modes are unusable except at the developers website (like insane difficulty in Age of War 2). Then there are the most severe ones, like Nitrome games where the game will flat out say that you are not allowed to play the game anywhere, except from their website (note: I will not personally host Nitrome games as that can legally be problematic). This depends on how they implement it. Some may have a website whitelist (allow list) where you can only play the game if it if specifically on the whitelist. You could simply get around that by adding your website's name to the whitelist. Some games (especially popular with Kongregate) have a check that sees if the game is being ran on Kongregate or not, and how to handle the game in each case (like the game may have ads if they aren't on Kongregate and no ads if they are on Kongregate). An easy way around this is to swap the rules around so it pretends that all non Kongregate websites are Kongregate websites instead. Those are just a few of many examples that I've seen while doing this. 

Q: How did you make X hack?

A: A lot of them are just me messing around with things randomly. Of course, by exploring, you could get a sense of where things are and how things work. For example, if you find what is causing you damage when you walk into spikes, you could delete or change the code that makes you take damage and make it do 0 damage or heal you insteaad. Invincibility hacks could work by removing the code that makes it so you die or take damage upon touching a hazard, like spikes or enemies or changing the death function to do nothing. Money hacks could be achieved by finding what sets your money (which may be 0 if you start with none, or a predetermined amount if the game starts you off with a specific amount) and setting it to a higher amount, or if you can't find that, you could set prices for shop items to a negative number so buying items would give you money instead of taking it away. It varies by game and by what hack is being made. 

Q: Flash has been dead for a while as most browsers no longer support it. How are we supposed to play these? 

A: ~~There are quite a few ways that you can still play them unofficially. If you add them to a website, people may play them with [Y8 Browser](https://www.y8.com/download-app), [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/#downloads), [Supernova (Chrome only)](https://www.getsupernova.com/extension/), or through [Adobe's Flash player projector](https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html) (currently the only official method of doing so). I will not give support over any method used unless the problem is related to a sitelock that I missed.~~

I rewrote this response [here](https://github.com/PokemonHacker1337/Play-Flash-Games-In-2021/blob/main/README.md)

Q: Why would you make a hack for this game? X already made a better one.

A: Probably. I'm just doing this for fun, not to be professional or anything. 

Q: I tried hacking a game, and it froze/did something it shouldn't do, which didn't happen before I hacked it. What gives?

A: FFdec (I haven't tried others) is entirely experimental with the ActionScript editing function. I recommend editing by P-Code (the input box on the right side) instead. It is in a different form, but if you can understand the concepts of AS, you shouldn't have a hard time figuring out how P-Code editing works. Since AS editing is experimental, it commonly causes unexpected issues with recompiling. 

Q: With FFdec, how do I run games that require extra files (Example: Commando Assault) properly?

A: (Only known fix works in Windows) Place the required files/folders in the folder %temp% (By default, it's at C:/Users/%username%/AppData/Local/Temp), and that's it. 

Q: What's the point in playing a hacked game? That just takes the fun out of it.

A: Well, I'm not sure why you are here then, to be honest. Some games take way too long to beat or are simply too hard. Or maybe just for the fun of it, like as I mentioned above, getting endgame content early so you can practice with it. Or even just wiping out RPG bosses in seconds that normally give players a hard time to beat.

Q: Do you put any DRM in your hacks?

A: I don't. I want people to be able to edit them and learn from others. The hacks I make are absolutely not the only ways to hack, and definitely not the only hacks a game can have. Placing any kind of DRM or protection honestly seems silly and counterproductive to progress. I do acknowledge the possiblity of someone just taking a hack and claiming that they made it when they didn't. While I'd rather not have people do that, at the same time, I'd rather have people be able to improve it than to not have my work stolen. 

Q: Why did you remove the Nitrome hacks?

A: It has been brought to my attention by a member of FGA that Nitrome takes legal action against those who rehost their games, which is honestly pretty petty when they don't leave legitimate ways to play their games since Flash is no longer available. They are probably available on [the Internet archive](https://archive.org).

To be continued, probably.

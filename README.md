# HackedFlashGames
Flash games that I have personally hacked. You may take these without crediting me, although it would be appreciated if you did. Feel free to download these for yourself or reupload for others to play.

10 More Bullets:
All purchases give coins instead of taking, including buying more bullets.

13 Days After:
Start with all guns, start with 1000000 of all ammo types, start with lots of supplies. (Note: Getting new weapons is bugged, so never assign a survivor to search for weapons and ammo).

Ace Gangster Taxi:
Start with $999999, infinite nitro, upgrades unlocked.

American Racing:
Start with $1000000, infinite boost.

Age of War:
Start with $999999999 and 200000 XP, the cooldown for special moves has been disabled (note: if you try to spam special moves, it will cancel out the previous special move used so you cannot simply spam them).

Age of War 2:
Start with lots of money and XP, the cooldown for special moves has been disabled (ignore the cooldown timer), insane difficulty unlocked, infinite population.

Drag Race Demon:
Start with $9999, infinite fuel, infinite lives. (Technically, it's also possible to disable the opponent from being able to move, but I decided against it)

Drag Race Demon DX:
Start with $9999, infinite lives

Drag Race Demon 2:
Start with $99999, infinite lives, nitro lasts forever. (Side note: you can use nitro before the race for a free head start)

Dune Buggy:
Infinite health and lives (I decided against time as I kept getting softlocked in testing).

Earn to Die:
Infinite money (all prices are negative, so you get money instead of losing it), infinite fuel and boost, gun has +1000 ammo.

Earn to Die 2012: 
Start with $999999999, nearly infinite ammo (more than you'd use), infinite fuel, infinite boost.

Earn to Die 2012: Part 2:
Same as Earn to Die 2012

Earn to Die 2: Exodus:
Same as Earn to Die 2012. 

Exit Path:
Infinite Flow (boost), invincibility (except when falling down a pit), all cosmetic items unlocked.

Exit Path 2:
Infinite overFlow, invincibility, infinite midair jumps.
(Note: this is a little bugged. I don't know if I ever am going to come back to this, but a cracked version is available in the cracked folder if you want to try it yourself. I'm aware of the following bugs, but I don't really know how to fix them: Crash after finishing the game and most obstacles have graphical bugs (like the circle saws animate weirdly and the lasers don't go off. The latter might be an issue of the way I programmed the invincibility (removing the code that makes you die when you touch certain objects). I'll make a version of this without invincibility as I believe that that is the cause. Another issue is the intro and finishing cutscenes. I can't do much there as they are supposed to run a .flv file from the Internet at a website that is no longer around (so it never loads, and I'm glad that you are allowed to skip the cutscenes). I did get the cutscenes from Flashpoint, but I'm not sure how to set it up in a way that it will work. At the moment, I cannot recommend using this one unless you want invincibility and are willing to sacrifice having bugs).

Exit Path 2 (1.1):
Infinite overFlow, infinite midair jumps.

Flight:
Infinite Fuel, upgrades give money. 

Gazzoline:
Start with $99999, 10x walking speed.

Learn to Fly:
Infinite fuel, all upgrades are free.

Learn to Fly Idle:
1st 3 enemies give extra money (I couldn't figure out how to make it infinite or make upgrades free :-(), start a new game to start with max research upgrades and a lot of money (Click the settings icon in the lower right and choose "new game")

Mario Racing Tournament:
Start with 99999 coins. Everything in the shop can be upgraded up to 255 (allowing one to go very fast if they wish).

Potty Racers:
Infinite money (buying upgrades isn't broken, you have to buy the upgrades in order), infinite fuel (I set it to 65535 as I struggled to figure out how to set up infinite fuel at first).

Start with $1000000, infinite fuel.
